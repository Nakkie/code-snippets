# Code-Snippets

    WARNING

This repository contains code that is equivalent to cars in the madmax universe

They might not always be pretty

They might not always be the best

But they work... to an extent

## General overview

There are folders in here that pertain to some technology that I've worked with over the years

It's here as ease of reference for myself to just come and copy stuff that I need without having to troll the internet or my browser history for that one thing I saw on StackOverflow once

Feel free to grab whatever you might find useful, however if it so happens to blow up spectacularly, I really don't care, fix it, it's part of the gig
