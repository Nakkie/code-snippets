# MySQL Readme

    - If you are using MySQL 5.7 when reading this, I feel for you bud 

This folder contains the following SQL files;

    - cursor
    - events
    - running_tasks

## cursor

A cursor template

## events

Creating events because no Job Scheduler, MS SQL really spoils you

## running_tasks

What's running and how to kill it

If you don't have a mysql.general_log

    1. Sorry that your life sucks
    2. This is why we don't need DBA's
