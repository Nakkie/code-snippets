    - This is not the best python code, this is just a tribute

This folder contains the following Python files;

    - repo_migrate_no_history
    - migrate_deltas

## repo_migrate_no_history

But Nakkie, why you no use the import function on github?
Cause someone pushed and merge secrets, that's why

## migrate_deltas

Why would you ever want to use this?
Because of corporate redtape around repo access and WHEN, not WHY, WHEN people are allowed to access them
